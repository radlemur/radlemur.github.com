Think you have what it takes? Consequence is a physics mind-bender where you get to use black holes, white holes, timers and other obstacles to your advantage!

Clear the red balls off the screen, but keep the green ones in play. Use the yellow ones in combos, deflect off the fixed purple ones.

Watch our for black holes attracting stuff or white holes pushing things out. Coordinate the timed balls to go off at the right time.

Now with level editor - create your own levels and share them online!
